# Regular RGB-Video Based Eye Movement Assessment for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease
Due to privacy considerations, we can only share the extracted time series data rather than the original facial video recordings. This time series data represents the core information needed for eye movement analysis and PD classification research. 

The model shared in this page is a simplified version (1st row in the following table, using only 1 facial recoding and without enriched physical features).

It still achieves pretty good performance with balanced accuracy of 0.84 on a 5 fold cross validation. After the discussion with our partner in the medical side and solving copyright problem, we may be able to release the full model in the future.
